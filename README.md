 Android Project: Online Computer Shop
A client may create a profile (username, password, e-mail). A client profile has access to the shop, which is categorised by different computer parts (screen, mouse, GPU, CPU etc.) and accessories. A client may add different elements to a basket, then proceed to the checkout. After the products have arrived, the client may rate the vendor (0-5 stars). A computer parts vendor may create a profile (username, password, produce-type/description, e-mail, phone, bank account). A vendor has the possibility of putting products on sale. If the shop already has the offered product, then the product stock will be increased. The vendor has a rating which appears only after 5 client-given ratings. If the average ratings drop below 2.5, then the vendor may be banned from the online shop at the next bad rating (0-2). An admin is a private account (username, password). The admin has the possibility of deleting clients and vendors. The admin has the possibility of gaining some shop stats (total price of the products on-stock, number of clients, number of vendors, number of different products, total sales during the last week).
